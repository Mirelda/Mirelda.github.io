I'm sharing my version 1 blog page with HTML CSS and a little touch of JS.

I preferred to use a structure where basic HTML structures are used and the page layout structure can be understood using only css. Only script is used for the drop down menu.

The image used in the background was made by me, even though it is a bit of an eye candy at first glance.
