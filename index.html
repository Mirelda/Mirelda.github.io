        <h1 class="Aboutme">About me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Mirelda ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a business analyst with three years of experience, currently honing my skills in
            backend development through various projects and studying Full Stack Software Development at
            Lambton College.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my career, I have worked extensively on data and business analysis, aiming to improve business
            processes and enhance efficiency. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn
            new things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm orchestrating comprehensive analyses and driving strategic developments at
            SmartPulse Technology Inc. I leverage tools like Miro and PowerBI to visualize data and create
            actionable insights. I also optimize Azure environments and support application tools to drive
            business growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, I managed a freelance project focusing on screen analysis and marketing strategies at
            Hitsoft, where I used my analytical skills and creative thinking to deliver impactful results. Additionally,
            I worked on developing forecasting algorithms for renewable energy production efficiency at SmartPulse
            Technology Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            With skills in data visualization, UI/UX design, and web development, I am passionate about using
            technology to solve complex problems. I look forward to continuing my journey and making
            meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
        </p>
